Effervescence or Effervescence Viewer (EV) is a client for Second Life and like
metaverses. It is a fork and derivitive work of the Singularity Viewer conducted
by Siana Gearz; Singularity began in November 2010 by forking it from the Ascent
Viewer, by Balseraph Software Group, which in turn was based upon source code
modified from the Snowglobe source code released by Linden Lab.
